### Video Materials
We've produced exciting videos that go over the topics outlined in our lesson plan. These can serve as inspiration for how you could conduct your lessons, be used alongside your own explanations to help students visualize certain concepts, or even act as their own stand-alone lesson.

## Worksheet
### Part 1: Cats on the Run!

Let’s make the Scratch Cat run away from the mouse pointer!

- First, set up the program so that it starts when we click the flag and runs forever.

- Then, create a conditional that runs if the pointer gets too close to Scratch.

- Finally, complete the conditional to make Scratch run away from the pointer!



Here's a block bank to get you started!

### Part 2: A Wild Cat Chase!



Let’s make the Scratch Cat run towards the mouse whenever it’s held down! Whenever the user lets go of the mouse, Scratch should spin around!

    - Again, set up the program so that it starts when we click the flag and runs forever.

    - Next, create a conditional that runs if the mouse is held down.

    - Finally, complete the conditional to make Scratch run to the pointer or spin around!!



Here are the blocks you should use!

### Part 3: Upside-Downsizing!



Let’s make Scratch grow or shrink when we press the arrow keys!



![image #3](/assets/images/week2/img3.png)



    - One more time, set up the program so that it starts when we click the flag and runs forever.

    - Now, create two conditionals: one that runs if the up arrow, and one that runs if the down arrow is pressed.

    - Finally, complete the conditionals to make Scratch grow or shrink!



Here's one more block bank, but beware! You might need to use some of these twice!

### Questions to Discuss



How do conditionals fit into our maze game?



What else can you imagine doing in Scratch with conditionals?



Where do you see conditionals in your daily life?
